Add indication if show_list data has been updatted, or if its the old show information
We need to be able to know how many total tuners we have.
 then run mytimeslot_build(num_of_tuners)
 We can start with marking the existing shows in showlist
--Added ability to fix invalid show directory on launch.

Fix issue where selecting  multipe shows may cause an issue with is_sport popup

Todo:
NEED option to quit after recording is complete. 
NEED Prompt user to update show with a valid tuner.
--add display on main screen to show next recording.  Check that time, and see if multiple shows are being recorded at the time. -Done
--This may just evolve into a futurerecording search, which we could use to not over book recording times. -In Progress
--rewrite next_show to be more like recording_now 

tell application "JSON Helper"

--First variable sets capitalization  

--on recording_search(caller,start_time, end_time, hdhr_model)
--This would return the number of shows being recorded at the time 
--I can use JSONHelper to make a config file, but items need to be a number, a string, or a boolen.  We may need to stringify anything else, to get it to save, This is pretty consistant, but if we hit an error, we really blow up

	This really kicks us off.  The will query to see if there are any HDHomeRun devices on the local network.  This script support multiple devices.
	Once we find some devices, we will query them and pull there lineup data.  This tells us what channels belong to what tags, like "2.4 TPTN"
	We will then pull guide data.  It should be said here that this data is only given for 4 hours ahead of current time, some stations maybe 6.  Special considerations have been made in this script to make this work.  We call this handler and specify "run0".  This is just a made up string that we pass to the next handler, so we can see the request came in that broke the script.  This is commonly repeated in my scripts.
